1 . DTGP method must include the DTGP method in the dsdt table under the top level scope mean not inside any device
2. the codec-id can get in linux and my alc892 codec id is 0x10ec0892 scheme 0xvendor id + device id so hte 10ec is the realtk vendor and my id is 0892
    and the layoutid mean the line-in and out struct usually laptop should be 3 and begin with 07
    
3.the dsdt patch with clover (like rename IGFXO to IGPU) just apply to the dsdt and the native ssdt it's very important to know that
these patches do not apply to the ACPI/patches in you place in the clover


4. Note: All ACPI identifiers are 4 characters. Shorter names are padded with underscore. So, for example, XHC is represented in the AML binary as XHC_, EC would be EC__, EC0 would be EC_, MEI would be MEI_, etc.

5. my alc892 laptop layout id is 4
